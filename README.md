# School District Analysis
## Project Overview
I was tasked to help to prepare all standaradized test data for analysis, reporting, and presentation to provide insights on performance trends and patterns for 15 different high schools within a school disctrict. Once the analysis was complete it was reported that there was evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders that were altered. I had to go in and change all grades for those particular students to a null value and refactor the overall analysis.

## Results
- How is the district summary affected?
  - As you can see in the below pictures, the average math score, % passing math, % passing reading, and % overall passing dropping by a small margin after adjusting the Thomas High School 9th graders grades to NaN.
